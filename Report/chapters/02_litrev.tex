\subsection{Known Issues}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1)] The theta of self robot is calculated wrongly some times, since the rear of self robot is not recognized.
    \item[2)] Once any part of robot move out of the map (as shown in Figure \ref{wrong_position}), the code will report an error that the access error as shown in Figure \ref{access_error}. This is the reason that the algorithm is trying to read a memory address is out of the map, which is larger than the coordinates of image. But according to the competition rules, this should be avoided.
\end{enumerate}
