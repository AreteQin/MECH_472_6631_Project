\textbf{\large Qiaomeng Qin(40207375)}\\[0.5cm]
Design and implement an Image Processing algorithm to locate and identify all objects in the map. Design and implement an Hiding Strategy to find the closest safe point.

\textbf{\large Xiaobo Wu(40216033)}\\[0.5cm]
Design and implement a path planning algorithm (ASIA) by myself to find a collision-free sequence of motions (path point) between an initial(current) position and a final(expected) position and complete this part report. Design a hiding of robot algorithm with Qiaomeng Qin and write the report of this part.

\textbf{\large Mario Araujo(40059376)}\\[0.5cm]
